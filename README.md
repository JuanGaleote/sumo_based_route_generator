# sumo_based_route_generator

A soft package developed in MATLAB for generating real traffic routes for pedestrian, cars, bikes, trucks... based on SUMO simulator from Eclipse.
Needed to be install before using:
  - The SUMO software (https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/).
  - The tool TraCi for MATLAB (https://github.com/pipeacosta/traci4matlab).

It can be used for general purpose but, in fact, it has been developed for route generation for a 5G mobility analysis tool simulation, also developed in MATLAB.
